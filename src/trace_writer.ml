(* A practical, but not perfect, fix for #155: If events happen with the exact same timestamp
   as a decode error, stacks break. We implement this "#155 hack" to prevent that:

       If an event happens at exactly the same time as the previous decode error, slide it forward
       by one nanosecond. Maintain the invariant that no event which follows a decode error has the
       same timestamp as that decode error.

   This should have minimal impact on the timestamps displayed to the user, they're precise to at
   most ~40ns anyhow. But it does make sure our stacks always come out in the right order.

   Also worth noting is that despite the fact that we're changing timestamps, this can't reorder
   events. 1ns is the minimum amount of time by which timestamps can differ. So even if there were
   more events exactly 1ns after the decode error, they'll be seen as having the exact same
   timestamp as the events that happened during the decode error. *)
