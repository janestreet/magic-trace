(** The logic for this function is derived from perf [0].
    This function is used to change the symbols in the application
    executable from a mangled form to a demangled form in ocaml. Now
    when running [magic-trace run -trigger] the symbols will appear in
    their demangled form. Will return None if the symbol is not
    recognized as an OCaml symbol.
